## Lucian Istrati - ML Engineer and AI Enthusiast

I am a Machine Learning Engineering involved in multiple AI-related projects, the two on which I focus the most are a business one with a friend and a volunteering oriented one inside ["Integritate pe Bune"](https://integritatepebune.ro/) NGO.

I have two years of working experience in Machine Learning. I worked with all kinds of data in my ML engineering roles: video, image, text, biological, timeseries and tabular.

My personal projects are various from timeseries analysis & forecasting to information extraction & name entity recognition, from various text classifications & visualization projects to multimodal & representational models.

On the educational side I graduated one year ago with Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at University of Bucharest. I am midway through my Master of Science Degree in Data Science at the same university. For the future I am considering starting a Ph.D. Degree in Machine Learning next year, most likely in France or Germany.

I have also plenty of interest into research, unfortunately I managed to publish just one paper so far with some other works being left unfinished. Hopefully with time I will have more stuff to showcase on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucian-Istrati-2) and [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=us0728YAAAAJ&citft=1&citft=2&citft=3&email_for_op=lucian.istrati%40my.fmi.unibuc.ro)

My main interests are in Natural Language Understanding (especially Information Extraction & Multi-level Text analysis), Timeseries (Analysis / Forecasting / Anomaly detection), Representational Learning, Multimodal Learning and Recommender Systems.
