## Lucian Istrati - ML Engineer and AI Enthusiast

I am a Machine Learning Engineering involved in multiple AI-related projects, the two on which I focus the most are a business one with a friend and a volunteering oriented one inside "Integritate pe Bune" NGO.

On the educational side I graduated one year ago with Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at University of Bucharest. I am midway through my Master of Science Degree in Data Science at the same university and I am thinking about starting a Ph. D. Degree in Machine Learning next year.

I have also some interests into Research, unfortunately I managed to publish just one paper so far with some other works being left unfinished. Hopefully with time I will have more stuff to showcase on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucian-Istrati-2) and [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=us0728YAAAAJ&citft=1&citft=2&citft=3&email_for_op=lucian.istrati%40my.fmi.unibuc.ro)
